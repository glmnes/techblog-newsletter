# AI Coding Assistants: The Good, Bad, and Weird

Everyone's using AI for coding now. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT... the list goes on. Here's what I've learned after using them for a while.

## What They're Great At

### Boilerplate Code

Need a React component with TypeScript? API endpoint with error handling? AI's got you:

```typescript
// You type: "create user api endpoint with validation"
// AI generates all this:

app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, name } = req.body;
    
    if (!email || !name) {
      return res.status(400).json({ 
        error: 'Email and name are required' 
      });
    }
    
    const user = await User.create({ email, name });
    res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Server error' });
  }
});
```

Saves so much typing.

### Explaining Code

Found some weird regex or complex algorithm? Ask AI to explain it. Way faster than trying to decode it yourself.

### Writing Tests

AI is surprisingly good at writing tests. Give it a function, it'll write test cases you didn't even think of.

## Where They Struggle

### Business Logic

AI doesn't know your specific requirements. It'll give you generic solutions that might not fit your use case.

### Latest Frameworks

Training data has a cutoff. Asking about the newest Next.js features? You might get outdated info.

### Debugging Complex Issues

"Why doesn't this work?" isn't a great prompt. AI needs context, and sometimes the bug is in a completely different file.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific**: "Create a custom React hook for fetching user data with loading and error states" beats "make a hook"

2. **Review everything**: AI can confidently write broken code. Always test what it gives you.

3. **Use it for learning**: Ask it to explain its solutions. Great way to learn new patterns.

4. **Don't rely on it completely**: It's a tool, not a replacement for understanding your code.

## My Workflow

Here's how I actually use these tools:

- **Copilot**: For inline suggestions while coding
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: For planning architecture or debugging weird errors  
- **Cursor**: When I need to refactor large chunks of code

## The Reality

AI coding assistants are like autocomplete on steroids. They won't write your entire app, but they'll speed up the boring parts. 

Sometimes they'll suggest something brilliant you didn't think of. Sometimes they'll confidently write complete nonsense. The trick is knowing the difference.

Are they worth it? Absolutely. Will they replace developers? Not anytime soon... they still need us to tell them what to build and fix their mistakes.

Just remember: AI is a junior developer who's read every programming book ever written but has never actually shipped anything. Use accordingly.
